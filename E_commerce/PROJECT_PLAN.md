# E-commerce Project Development Plan

This document outlines a hypothetical 10-week development plan for the E-commerce project, distributing key features and tasks across each week.

## Week 1: Project Setup & Core Product Catalog

*   **Objective**: Initialize the Django project and establish the foundational product and category models.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Django project and app (`base`) setup.
    *   Define `Category` and `Product` models in `base/models.py` with essential fields (name, description, price, image).
    *   Configure basic admin interface for `Category` and `Product` models.
    *   Set up static and media file configurations for development.
    *   Run initial database migrations (`python manage.py migrate`).

## Week 2: User Authentication & Basic Profiles

*   **Objective**: Implement core user authentication flows and a basic user profile.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `user` app.
    *   Implement user registration, login, and logout views and templates.
    *   Configure Django's built-in authentication system.
    *   Create a simple user profile page displaying basic user information.
    *   Set up URL routing for authentication.

## Week 3: Advanced User Features & Admin Integration

*   **Objective**: Enhance user management with password reset and refine admin interfaces.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Implement password reset functionality (email configuration, views, templates).
    *   Allow users to edit their basic profile information.
    *   Integrate user management into the Django admin, customizing user display.
    *   Ensure secure handling of user data.

## Week 4: Product Listing & Detail Views

*   **Objective**: Display products to users with basic navigation and individual product details.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Develop views for listing all products and products filtered by category (`base/views.py`).
    *   Create a detailed product view page (`base/views.py`) showing all product attributes.
    *   Design and integrate responsive templates for product listings and detail pages.
    *   Implement basic search functionality for products (e.g., by name).

## Week 5: Shopping Cart Core Functionality

*   **Objective**: Enable users to add products to a shopping cart and manage its contents.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `order` app.
    *   Define `Cart` and `CartItem` models to store cart contents.
    *   Implement views and logic for adding products to the cart.
    *   Develop views for updating product quantities in the cart and removing items.
    *   Display the current cart contents in a dedicated cart page.

## Week 6: Advanced Cart & Checkout Initiation

*   **Objective**: Refine the shopping cart experience and begin the checkout process.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Implement cart persistence (e.g., using sessions or database for logged-in users).
    *   Add functionality to clear the entire cart.
    *   Develop the initial checkout views to collect shipping and billing information.
    *   Validate user input for shipping details.

## Week 7: Order Creation & History

*   **Objective**: Finalize the order creation process and allow users to view past orders.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Implement the logic to convert a cart into a confirmed `Order`.
    *   Define `Order` and `OrderItem` models to store order details.
    *   Display a comprehensive order summary before final confirmation.
    *   Create a user-specific order history page, listing all past orders.

## Week 8: Payment Integration & Order Management

*   **Objective**: Integrate a payment gateway and provide administrative tools for managing orders.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `payment` app.
    *   Define `Payment` model to record transaction details.
    *   Integrate with a chosen payment gateway API (e.g., using the `STORE_ID` and `STORE_PASS` from settings, or a more advanced mock payment system).
    *   Handle payment success and failure scenarios, updating order status accordingly.
    *   Implement secure payment processing practices.
    *   Enhance `Order` model in the admin interface for comprehensive management (e.g., filtering, searching).
    *   Implement order status updates (e.g., pending, processed, shipped, delivered) within the admin.

## Week 9: UI/UX Refinements & Frontend Polish

*   **Objective**: Improve the overall user experience and visual appeal of the application.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Conduct a thorough review of all templates for consistency, responsiveness, and user experience.
    *   Optimize static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) for performance.
    *   Implement minor UI/UX improvements across all pages.
    *   Ensure cross-browser compatibility.
    *   Address any remaining bugs and perform performance optimizations.

## Week 10: Chatbot Integration & Documentation

*   **Objective**: Integrate a conversational AI chatbot and finalize project documentation.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create `chatbot` app and integrate `langchain` libraries.
    *   Develop basic chatbot functionality (e.g., answering FAQs, providing product information).
    *   Design a user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
    *   Final review and update of project documentation (`README.md`, `PROJECT_PLAN.md`).
